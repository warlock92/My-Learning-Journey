					<p>
					First, let me introduce myself. My name is Deeban Babu, and I’m a budding full-time front end developer with 2 months project experience. In this time, I’ve worked on a HTML and CSS basics through Pyoopel Learning platform with Bharat Patodi.

					I’ll start off with my journey, including what went wrong along the way. If you just care about what my suggestions for the shortest possible route to becoming a web developer from scratch are, feel free to skip to the last section: The shortest route.
				
					</p>

					<h3>Getting the Basics</h3>

					<p>After deciding I wanted to get into web development the first question on my mind was “What do I learn?” After doing some research, I ended up making my learning path based on what most entry-level web developer positions asked for, which was: </p>

					<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
						<li>Javascript</li>
						<li>HTML & CSS</li>
						<li>Git</li>
						<li>Responsive Design</li>
						<li>AngularJS</li>
						<li>NodeJS</li>

					</ul>

					<p>Here’s how it's going on.</p>

					<h3>Journey So Far</h3>

					<p> I enrolled in Pyoopel online Web development programming course. I was under the impression initially that like other MOOCs this is also be going to be like classroom approach program. But to my surprise it's the other way round. We have to build projects from scratch using available internet resources within deadline.This single idea has infact helped in learning and developing projects from scratch and has not only tested development skills but also googling skills. :P </p>

					<p>So now let's dive into projects I had developed so far and the resources I am learning from.</p>

					<h3>Projects Developed</h3>

  						<div class="call-out">

						<p><b>A single-screen website that has a picture and a motivational textual quote</b></p>

						<p>The deliverable was to create a github repository with completed code with a timeline of 15 Days. Being new to domain this was really daunting at first but looking back now this was my baby step</p>

					<h3>A word on paid courses</h3>

						<p>I felt a need to speak about this since I’ve noticed the general consensus that you can learn programming without paying a dime and be as competitive as one that paid for a course. While true, I cannot stress enough the value paying for the right course has. Sure, quite a lot of the most valuable course material I’ve written about is free, but a lot of it is also paid. Mainly because sometimes you just can’t beat having someone carefully explain things to you in a visual way.</p>

						<p>Yes, there are terrible learning paid courses which I would advise against since their value proposition is questionable , but others like <a href="https://www.pyoopel.com/p/learn-programming">Pyoopel.com </a> offer outstanding bang-for-your-buck. Plus, they all have free 7–15 day trials so you can see which one works best for you.</p>
						
						<p>If you play your cards right, paying 1–2 months of either of them can easily net you knowledge you would only otherwise get after stumbling upon countless of articles and blog posts over a year. They’re honestly that good.</p>
						<p>So yes, they are not necessary, but if you can afford at least one month, you can be sure it will give you a strong edge.</p>
